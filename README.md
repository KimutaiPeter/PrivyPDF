        <p style={{ width: '500px' }} >I enjoy how similar apps like <a href='https://tinywow.com/tools/pdf' >Tinywow</a> and <a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/">I love PDFs</a> offer a simple, free, quick and convinient way to merge or split files and more, I also love how I dont have to install any application in my machine, but then sometimes I need to do such functions on very sensitive documents and I am abit speculative about someone keeping them sensitive documents, So I developed this app, what is important is that It doesnt keep files, more so, the file never leaves your machine, or go through the network. </p>
